# Network Measure-Enriched Graph Neural Networks: A New Benchmark for Power Grid Stability Assessment

![NSGNN-viz](./NSGNN.png)

Can network measures enhance the predictive capability of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for the stability of power grids, and can they aid in the generalization of models to real-world networks?

The answer is affirmative. In our paper, we present, for the first time, a benchmark that analyzes 48 network measures within the context of GNN-based stability assessments, introducing two strategies for their integration into the GNN framework: NSGNN-F and NSGNN-S.

Our findings reveal that prioritizing measures with consistent distributions across different grids as inputs or treating measures as auxiliary supervised information significantly improves the modelâ€™s generalization ability to realistic grid topologies.

In this *NSGNN* package we provide several Network Measure encodings and GNN model choices, implementing for both NSGNN-F and NSGNN-S. One can easily try our model with different GNN layer or different combination of network measures. NSGNN is built based on [PyG](https://www.pyg.org/), [GraphGym](https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/2.0.0/notes/graphgym.html) from PyG2, and [GraphGPS](https://github.com/rampasek/GraphGPS). We thank them for providing the codes and tools.
Specifically *PyG v2.2* is required.
